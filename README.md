## Overview
The objective of this project is to develop an effective, multi-class classification model for the Chicago Traffic Crashes Dataset available from the <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Crashes/85ca-t3if">Chicago Data Portal<a>. This dataset is vast in size, containing detailed information on roughly 500,000 traffic crashes since 2015 when the dataset was first created. In particular, this study is concerned with predicting the primary contributory causes of these various accidents. A highly efficient model that could deduce the most salient cause of a car crash could be helpful for crash report formulation. In addition, it could be used to distinguish the factors that are widespread among all crashes as well as those that are particular to crashes arising from given circumstances.

## Business Understanding
This study is framed from the point of view of the governmental agencies of the city of Chicago, namely those behind the <a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdot/supp_info/vision-zero-chicago.html">Vision Zero Chicago</a> initiative, which is dedicated to reducing (or ideally, eliminating) fatal and incapacitating injuries arising from tragic, and largely avoidable traffic accidents. The purpose of this project is, thus, to provide the city of Chicago with valuable insight regarding the most causatory factors of fatal and non-fatal traffic crashes, as well as a predictive model that can be used in cases where an officer is not available to make a judgement regarding the most likely primary cause. In a perfect world, every car crash would easily be assigned a primary cause with sound judgement from those who report them. However, this dataset makes it abundantly clear that the realm of automobile accidents is far from perfect. A sizeable portion of the data does not contain data attributing a cause fto
